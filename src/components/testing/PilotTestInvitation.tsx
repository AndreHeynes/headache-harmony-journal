Dear ${recipientName},

I'm excited to invite you to participate in the pilot testing phase of Headache Experience Journal, a new application designed to help users better understand and manage their headache experiences.

Purpose of Testing:
The main objective of this pilot testing is to gather valuable feedback on the usability, functionality, and effectiveness of our application before its official launch. Your insights will directly influence the final product and help us ensure it genuinely addresses the needs of people who experience headaches.

Duration of Testing:
The pilot testing period will run for two weeks, from ${startDate} to ${endDate}. During this time, we ask that you use the application as you normally would to track your headache experiences, explore the analysis features, and test various functionalities.

What's Involved:
- Use the app to log your headache experiences and related factors
- Explore the analysis dashboard to view patterns and insights
- Test both basic and premium features (all premium features will be available during testing)
- Provide feedback through the in-app feedback form or during our scheduled check-ins

How to Provide Feedback:
Our application includes a dedicated test dashboard accessible through the "Test" tab in the navigation menu. This dashboard allows you to:
- Submit detailed feedback on specific features
- Report any bugs or issues you encounter
- Suggest improvements or new features
- View your testing activity and analytics

We will also schedule a brief 15-minute check-in call midway through the testing period and a final 30-minute feedback session at the conclusion.

Getting Started:
1. Download the application using the link provided in your email
2. Create an account using the invitation code: ${invitationCode}
3. Enable "Test Mode" in your profile settings
4. Begin exploring and using the app

Your participation is entirely voluntary, and all data collected during this testing phase will be used solely for improving the application. Your personal headache data will not be shared with any third parties.

If you have any questions or need assistance during the testing period, please don't hesitate to contact me directly at ${contactEmail}.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to help shape the future of headache tracking and analysis. Your feedback is invaluable to us!

Sincerely,

The Headache Experience Journal Team
